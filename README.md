Here are somethings to know about me:

- I'm looking forward to contributing to open source documentation here on GitHub.
- I will forever be a life-long learner and writer. I'm currently learning about ethcical hacking, just for fun!
- Along with technical writing, I also enjoy reflective, inspirational blogging on Medium (https://medium.com/@LifeReloaded).
